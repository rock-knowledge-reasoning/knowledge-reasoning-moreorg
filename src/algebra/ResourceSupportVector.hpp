/**
 * A ResourceSupportVector describes resource availability as a vector
 * Each dimension stands for a specific resource type
 * The values provides the cardinality i.e. availability
 * of the resource which corresponds to that dimension.
 *
 * The ResourceSupportVector can accurately describe interdependencies
 * only when there are no overlapping dimensions, e.g., when
 * one dimension is the superclass of another computing the redundancy
 * will potentially contain an error, e.g.,
 * Assuming the following situation:
 *
 * Required resources are described by a vector: [1 1 1]^T, where
 * the corresponding (class labels) are [A B C]^T.
 * A is superclass of B, B is superclass of C.
 * Available resources are described by: [0 0 3]^T, so that
 * the requirements can be exactly covered.
 * However, using the dot product will fail since there is no exact match.
 * Thus, we update the required resources that each dimension takes into
 * account the required subclass instances:
 * [(1+2) (1+1) 1] = [3 2 1], i.e. three class of A are required two of B and 1
 * of C, and available accordingly [3 3 3].
 * It can be easily seen that the maximum achievable redundancy will be
 * exceeded with this update vector, thus we bound it based on the maximum
 * to be expected redundancy (0+0+3)/(1+1+1) = 1
 *
